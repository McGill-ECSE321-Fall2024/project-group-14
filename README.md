# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based application for an independent game shop. The owner seeks to expand their business by providing an online store where customers can browse and purchase video games. The project involves designing, developing, and testing a multi-tier software solution, as well as ensuring the system meets the specified requirements.
* Customers: buy/return games from the online shop; add games to wishlist; search for games by genre and rating; review games with discussion posts.
* Employees: update inventory; make recommendation requests to purchase new games; review games with discussion posts.
* Owner: approve employee game requests; manage store employees; review customers' order history.
* Games: games have different categories, ratings (R, G, PG-13, etc.) and reviews where discussion can occur. 

During the development process for this application, our team will follow the main software engineering activities: specification, development, validation, and evolution.
